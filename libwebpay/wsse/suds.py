    """Suds message plugin that performs WS-Security signing and encryption.

    Encrypts and signs outgoing messages (the soap:Body and the wsu:Timestamp
    security token, which must be present); decrypts and verifies signature on
    incoming messages.

    Uses X509 certificates for both encryption and signing. Requires our cert
    and its private key, and their cert (all as file paths).

    Expects to sign and encrypt an outgoing SOAP message looking something like
    this (xmlns attributes omitted for readability):

    <soap:Envelope>
      <soap:Header>
        <wsse:Security mustUnderstand="true">
          <wsu:Timestamp>
            <wsu:Created>2015-06-25T21:53:25.246276+00:00</wsu:Created>
            <wsu:Expires>2015-06-25T21:58:25.246276+00:00</wsu:Expires>
          </wsu:Timestamp>
        </wsse:Security>
      </soap:Header>
      <soap:Body>
        ...
      </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>

    The contents of the soap:Body element are specific to the receiving API;
    nothing in ``py-wsse`` knows or cares about them (except that currently
    only the first child element of the soap:Body will be encrypted).
